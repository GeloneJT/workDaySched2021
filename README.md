# Work Day Color-coded Scheduler


A simple browser based application allows user to keep track of tasks saved throughout the span of a 9am to 5pm work day. Clicking into the timebox allows the user to input and save text into the field. LocalStorage is used to persist data even upon page refreshes. Time of day is tracked using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). The colors occupying the field dynamically change according to the time of the day. 

- Grey Field for time passed
- Red Field for time current
- Green Field for time imminent
